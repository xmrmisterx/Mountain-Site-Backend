-alright, so we currently have the backend on our public html folder, which isn't ideal, bc that's where we want our website to go, so 
let's move that to a mountain site backend, where we also want to include the function to ping the site every 30 mins to keep it from 
sleeping
-ok, so first, we want to test and make sure this is working,then we'll add the 30 min ping thing and make sure that works (we need an
app name before we can do that, so create the app, then wait 30 mins and see if it pings itself, can we just send something when it 
pings? that would help us make sure it is pinging? but I guess we'll know if the website works since it'll not take forever lol)
-that's odd, it's just spinning the wheel and not doing anything, did we set up the backend right? this is really odd, it's not doing 
anything, it seems to be kind of stuck, this is the beginning of our error message "status: 503,
7:48:15 PM worker.1 |    statusText: 'Service Unavailable',
7:48:15 PM worker.1 |    headers: {"
-interesting, we can't seem to load our front end pages either, this is our front end page for reference "https://mighty-taiga-60726.
herokuapp.com/". maybe we've exceeded some limit, if we did, that's pretty annoying... we can work on our front end only website if this
is down, yeah, our engr site seems to be down too, very annoying, guess we'll have to work on the other website for now...
-ok, so today , whcih is about 24 hours later, it seems to be working now, which is good obv, just temporarily down, so that's good, we
didn't do something wrong is what we're happy about
-for the ping thing, I think what we'll do, is just ping from the engr website (which is always on), we'll ping all of our other apps
- ok, so now what... we can go to uptimebot and just delete all the monitors, then we can put this into the cloud
- for uploading to cloud, we need to change from the local port to the heroku port, then add the files, commit, and push, once again,
that's "git init" "git add ." "git commit -m [commit message]" "git push [app git address] master"
- ok, so we did all the git thing, but we don't have a git address yet? yeah, I think we forgot a step, to create heroku, to create an
app first, which is "heroku create" after we log in with "heroku login -i" and put in our email and school password
- *** ok, so we did that, and our APP ADDRESS is: https://dry-mesa-65447.herokuapp.com/ and our APP GIT ADDRESS is: 
https://git.heroku.com/dry-mesa-65447.git 
- yep, so we do all that, then to put the app into the cloud "git push [app git address] master", and the build was successful. we test
it for "denali" and "K2" get requests and it works, so, now let's go back to our front end, and send the GET requests here, instead of
to the other one
- ok, so changed our frontend app to call this backend app for the get requests, so I think this mountain website if finally working like we want it to, independent of the engr site
